The main code (*RUNME_NIR.R*) constains the model fitted using partial least squares (PLS) using PLS package.

The traits measurements and NIR data are available in the files: PG_WL.NIR.csv, 
weight_WL.NIR.csv, and sugars_WL.NIR.csv. The main script call all files and runs 
the analyses for all traits. The user should only change the trait name and specify the 'ncomp' accordingly.

If you have any questions about the analyses, please, contact me!
