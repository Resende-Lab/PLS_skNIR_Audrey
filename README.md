### Prediction of phytoglycogen content in sweet corn using Single-kernel Near-Infrared spectroscopy 

DOI:
***


The main code (*RUNME_NIR.R*) contains the model fitted using partial least squares (PLS) using the PLS package.

The trait measurements and NIR data are in the files: PG_WL.NIR.csv, 
weight_WL.NIR.csv, and sugars_WL.NIR.csv inside the folder datasetNIR. The main script calls all files and runs 
the analyses for all traits. The user should only change the trait name and specify the 'ncomp' accordingly.


***  

If you have any questions about the analyses, please, contact me!
