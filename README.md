### Prediction of phytoglycogen content in sweet corn using Single-kernel Near-Infrared spectroscopy 

The main code (*RUNME_NIR.R*) constains the model fitted using partial least squares (PLS) using PLS package.

The traits measurements and NIR data are available in the files: PG_WL.NIR.csv, Pericarp_WL.NIR.csv, and sugars_WL.NIR.csv.

The main script call all files and run the analyses for all traits. The user should only change the trait name.
